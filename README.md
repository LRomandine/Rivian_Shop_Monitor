# Rivian_Shop_Monitor
Monitor the availability of a specific vehicle configuration. This helped me find my configuration so sharing it for others to see, modify, whatever. I know it's ugly but this was not intended to be used for long, just something quick and dirty to do a job.

# Support
None whatsoever. 

# How I ran this
Ubuntu 22.04, chrome webdriver, selenium, python 3, mailx, running in a terminal in a VNC session with `watch -n 600 ./rivian_shop_selenium_runner.sh`. VNC session was 1080p, you need some vertical resolution otherwise buttons overlap and selenium crashes.

# If you want to use this
Modify the python code to fit your preferred configuration options. Read the text on the website and edit to fit your config, then run it to test.
